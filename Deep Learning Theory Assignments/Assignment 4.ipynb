    "**Answer** TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework known for its flexibility, scalability, and efficient computation on GPUs and TPUs. Its main features include automatic differentiation, GPU support, distributed computing, and high-level APIs like Keras. Other popular deep learning libraries include PyTorch, Keras (which is now part of TensorFlow), and MXNet."

The main differences include TensorFlow's computation graph paradigm, which allows for deferred execution and optimization on GPUs/TPUs, and its focus on deep learning models with support for automatic differentiation and neural network layers."

While tf.range(10) creates a tensor representing the range from 0 to 9, tf.constant(np.arange(10)) creates a tensor with the values of the NumPy array np.arange(10). So the former is equivalent to tf.constant([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])."

    "**Answer**You would need to create a dynamic Keras model when the model's architecture needs to change dynamically based on input data or when the number of layers is determined at runtime. Dynamic models are useful for tasks like dynamic recurrent architectures (e.g., varying sequence lengths) or generative models that require different layer configurations. However, dynamic models cannot be converted to static graphs, which can lead to potential performance overhead, so it's best to use dynamic models only when necessary. You can create a dynamic Keras model by defining a model using the functional API with conditional statements and loops, allowing for flexibility in constructing the model architecture based on runtime conditions."
