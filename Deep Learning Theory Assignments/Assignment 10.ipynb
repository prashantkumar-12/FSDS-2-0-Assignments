    "On the other hand, use the REST API when you need a more straightforward and widely supported communication method. REST is easy to implement, and many clients can interact with it using standard HTTP requests. However, it may not be as efficient as gRPC for high-throughput scenarios."

    "Model Parallelism: In model parallelism, the model is divided into segments, and each segment is placed on a separate device or server. During inference or training, the data passes through the different model segments, and each segment processes a portion of the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Parallelism: In data parallelism, the model is replicated across multiple devices or servers, and each replica processes a different batch of data. Gradients are then accumulated across replicas and used to update the shared model parameters.\n",

    "Data parallelism is generally recommended because it is easier to implement and more efficient for distributed training. It allows for better hardware utilization by processing multiple data batches in parallel, leading to faster training and better scalability."

    "Mirrored Strategy: In mirrored strategy, each server contains a replica of the entire model. Each replica processes a portion of the data, and the gradients are synchronized across replicas using all-reduce operations.\n",

    "Parameter Server Strategy: In the parameter server strategy, each server holds a subset of the model's parameters. Workers process data and update the parameter servers with gradients.\n",

    "Multi-Worker Mirrored Strategy: A combination of mirrored and parameter server strategies that can be used with multiple workers.\n",
