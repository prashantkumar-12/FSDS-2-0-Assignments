    "**Answer**Beam Search and Its Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search is a search algorithm used in sequence generation tasks, especially in natural language processing and machine translation. It is used to generate the most probable sequence of words given a model's predictions and is an improvement over greedy search, which selects the word with the highest probability at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In beam search, instead of selecting the single highest-probability word at each time step, it keeps track of a fixed number (beam width) of the most probable sequences up to that point. It expands the search space by considering multiple possible next words and retains the top candidates based on their cumulative probabilities. This allows beam search to explore a larger portion of the search space and find more diverse and plausible sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search is beneficial for tasks where the output sequences can be highly ambiguous or have multiple valid solutions, such as machine translation or image captioning. It helps to improve the quality of generated sequences and reduce the risk of getting stuck in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement beam search, you can use TensorFlow's tf.nn.top_k() function to get the top-k most probable words at each step and keep track of the top-k sequences based on cumulative probabilities."

    "In the attention mechanism, the model computes attention weights for each input element (source sequence) based on its relevance to the current decoding step (target sequence). The attention weights represent how much attention the model should pay to each input element while making predictions. By attending to relevant parts of the input sequence, the model can better capture long-range dependencies and relationships between words.\n",

It is a fundamental building block of the Transformer and enables the model to attend to different positions in the input sequence to capture dependencies efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Self-Attention layer, the model computes attention scores between each pair of positions in the input sequence, allowing it to learn contextual relationships and dependencies across the entire sequence simultaneously. This layer is responsible for capturing global dependencies and facilitating parallelization, making it crucial for the Transformer's success in handling long sequences effectively."

    "When to Use Sampled Softmax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampled softmax is used in cases where the output vocabulary size is extremely large, making the standard softmax computation computationally expensive and memory-intensive. It is commonly employed in large language models and neural language models, where the output vocabulary can contain tens of thousands or even millions of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampled softmax approximates the full softmax by randomly sampling a small subset of the output vocabulary during training. This reduces the computational cost and allows training on smaller batches of data. While it introduces some noise due to sampling, it has been shown to be effective in large-scale language modeling tasks and significantly speeds up training in such scenarios."
