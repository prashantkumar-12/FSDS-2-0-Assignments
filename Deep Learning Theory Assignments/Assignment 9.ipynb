It can potentially learn to perform a trivial identity mapping, copying the input to the output without extracting meaningful features. The main risk of an overcomplete autoencoder is overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data instead of learning useful representations."

    "The point of tying weights is to reduce the number of parameters in the model, making it more memory-efficient and less prone to overfitting. Additionally, tied weights can help regularize the model and improve generalization by forcing the encoder and decoder to learn similar representations."
