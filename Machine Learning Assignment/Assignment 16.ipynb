    "Concept of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and a single independent variable (X) by fitting a straight line to the data points. The equation of a simple linear regression is Y = b0 + b1*X, where b0 is the y-intercept, and b1 is the slope of the line. It represents how Y changes with a unit change in X.\n",
    "Example: Predicting a student's exam score (Y) based on the number of hours studied (X). Here, the number of hours studied is the independent variable, and the exam score is the dependent variable."

    "In multiple linear regression, the \"Sum of Squares due to Error\" (SSE) is a measure of the variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the model. It represents the discrepancy between the actual values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the regression model. Minimizing the SSE is one of the key objectives in fitting a multiple linear regression model to the data."

    "**Answer**\n",
    "Multicollinearity in a regression equation occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It can cause problems in the regression model as it becomes challenging to distinguish the individual effects of the correlated variables on the dependent variable. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable coefficient estimates and reduced interpretability of the model."

    "**Answer**\n",
    "Heteroskedasticity refers to the situation in regression analysis where the variability of the residuals (the differences between the observed values and the predicted values) is not constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). It means that the spread of the residuals changes as the value of the independent variable changes. Heteroskedasticity violates the assumption of constant variance of residuals, which can affect the accuracy of statistical tests and confidence intervals in the regression model."

    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression technique used to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting in multiple linear regression models. It adds a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the sum of squared errors, which helps to shrink the coefficient estimates of correlated variables towards zero. This reduces the impact of multicollinearity and stabilizes the model."

    "Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is another regularized linear regression technique that combines variable selection with shrinkage. It adds a penalty term (L1 regularization) to the sum of squared errors, which can lead to some coefficient estimates being exactly zero. Lasso regression can be used for feature selection, as it tends to eliminate less important variables from the model."

    "Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis that allows the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be modeled as an nth-degree polynomial equation. It works by adding polynomial terms (such as x^2, x^3, etc.) to the linear regression equation, allowing the model to capture more complex nonlinear relationships between the variables."

It models the probability of the binary outcome as a function of the independent variables using the logistic (sigmoid) function. The logistic regression model outputs a probability score, and a threshold is used to make the final classification decision."
