    "##### 1.Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "**Answers**\n",
    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability views probability as a measure of subjective uncertainty or degree of belief. It considers probability as a subjective representation of an individual's confidence in an event's occurrence based on available information and prior beliefs. Bayesian probabilities are continually updated with new evidence using Bayes' theorem."
