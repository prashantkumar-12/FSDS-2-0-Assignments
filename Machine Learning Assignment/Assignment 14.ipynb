    "##### 1. What is the concept of supervised learning? What is the significance of the name?\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, consisting of input-output pairs. It aims to find a mapping from input features to the corresponding output labels, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data. The name \"supervised\" comes from the fact that the algorithm is guided by the supervisor (training data) to learn and make predictions."

    "3. A decision tree with inductive bias\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "The kNN algorithm has a validation flaw:\n",
    "The kNN algorithm does not involve explicit model training, and its \"training\" phase consists of memorizing the entire training dataset. Therefore, there is no separate model to validate, and traditional cross-validation is not applicable. Instead, a common practice is to split the dataset into training and testing sets, or use techniques like leave-one-out cross-validation for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the kNN algorithm, the k value is chosen:\n",
    "The kNN algorithm relies on the parameter \"k,\" which represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification. Selecting the appropriate value of \"k\" is essential. A smaller \"k\" value may lead to noisy decisions, while a larger \"k\" value might smooth out the boundaries between classes, potentially losing local patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree with inductive bias:\n",
    "A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a tree-like model to make decisions based on feature values. The tree is built through a top-down, recursive process that selects the best features to split the data at each node. The process has an inductive bias towards simple and interpretable models. It often results in deeper trees when there are many features or complex relationships in the data."
