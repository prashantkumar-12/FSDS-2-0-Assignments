    "##### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Give some examples to illustrate your point.\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data, where each input is associated with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling the model to make predictions on new, unseen data with labeled outputs. Example: Handwriting recognition (input: images of digits with corresponding labels).\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns from unlabeled data only. It aims to find patterns, structure, or representations in the data without specific output labels. Example: Clustering customer data into different segments based on similarities without predefined categories."

    "Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features while retaining important information, as in PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding).\n",

    "Three Main Types of Clustering Methods:\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of nested clusters. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\n",
    "Partitioning Clustering: Divides data into non-overlapping clusters. Examples include k-means and k-medoids algorithms.\n",

    "**Answer**\n",
    "Consistency of Clustering in k-means:\n",
    "The k-means algorithm determines the consistency of clustering by minimizing the sum of squared distances (SSE) between data points and their assigned cluster centroids. The algorithm iteratively updates the centroids and reassigns data points to clusters to minimize the SSE until convergence."

    "**Answer**\n",
    "Key Difference between k-means and k-medoids:\n",
    "Both k-means and k-medoids are partitioning clustering algorithms. However, while k-means uses the mean of data points to represent cluster centroids, k-medoids uses the actual data points (medoids) themselves as cluster centroids. K-medoids is more robust to outliers as it uses actual data points for clustering."

    "**Answer**\n",
    "Dendrogram:\n",
    "A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram used in hierarchical clustering to visualize the arrangement of data points into nested clusters. It illustrates the process of merging or splitting clusters at different distances. The y-axis represents the distance between clusters, and the x-axis represents the data points."

    "**Answer**\n",
    "SSE (Sum of Squared Errors):\n",
    "SSE is a measure of how well the data points in a cluster are grouped around their centroid in k-means clustering. It represents the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid. Minimizing SSE is the main objective of the k-means algorithm."

For example, if \"milk\" and \"bread\" are frequently bought together (a frequent itemset), the apriori algorithm can skip checking combinations like \"milk\" and \"bread\" with \"eggs\" as the support for the latter will be low."
