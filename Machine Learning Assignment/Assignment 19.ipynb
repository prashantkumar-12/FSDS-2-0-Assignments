    "Market Basket Analysis is a technique used in retail to discover association rules between items frequently purchased together. It leverages concepts from association analysis, such as support, confidence, and lift, to identify strong relationships between items in transactional data. For example, if customers often buy item A and item B together, Market Basket Analysis can help identify this frequent itemset and suggest strategies like placing these items closer in the store to increase sales."

The decision to stop the iteration is often based on a predetermined number of desired clusters or by analyzing the dendrogram to identify an optimal cut-off point."

    "One method for determining the required number of clusters is the \"Elbow Method.\" In this method, the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is calculated for different values of k (number of clusters). The SSE measures the total variation within clusters. When plotting SSE against the number of clusters, there may be a point on the graph that resembles an \"elbow,\" where the SSE decreases less rapidly as k increases. This point indicates an optimal number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce the SSE."
