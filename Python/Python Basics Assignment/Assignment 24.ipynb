    "#### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Relationship between def statements and lambda expressions:\n",
    "Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to define functions in Python.\n",
    "def statements are used to create regular, named functions that can have multiple lines of code and can be called by their names.\n",
    "lambda expressions, also known as lambda functions, are used to create small, anonymous functions with a single expression. They are typically used when a simple function is needed for a short period and don't require a name."

    "Lambda functions are concise and can be written in a single line, making the code more compact.\n",
    "They are useful for quick and temporary function definitions.\n",
    "Lambda functions can be used as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted()."

    "filter(function, iterable): Applies the specified function to each item in the iterable and returns an iterator with items that satisfy the condition defined in the function.\n",
    "reduce(function, iterable): Applies the specified function cumulatively to the items of the iterable from left to right to reduce it to a single value."

    "**Ans:** Function annotations:\n",
    "Function annotations are a way to attach metadata to function arguments and the return value.\n",
    "They are used to specify the expected type of function arguments and the return value, but they don't enforce any type checking.\n",
    "Function annotations are added as expressions following the function arguments, separated by colons."

    "Recursive functions are functions that call themselves during their execution.\n",

    "Recursion allows elegant and concise solutions for certain problems, like calculating factorials or Fibonacci numbers."

    "Functions should have a clear and descriptive name that indicates their purpose.\n",
    "Functions should be modular and perform a single task, making them easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "Functions should have a proper documentation string (docstring) that explains their purpose, arguments, and return values.\n",
    "Functions should use meaningful variable names and follow good coding practices for readability."

    "**Ans:** Ways functions can communicate results to a caller:\n",
    "Return statements: Functions can use return statements to send back a value to the caller.\n",
    "Print statements: Functions can use print statements to display intermediate results or debugging information.\n",
    "Exceptions: Functions can raise exceptions to signal errors or exceptional conditions to the caller.\n",
    "Global variables: Functions can modify global variables to communicate results outside the function scope. However, this is generally discouraged for clarity and maintainability."
