    "**Ans:** The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is their data structure and how they store elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: Stores elements in key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. Keys are used to access values, and dictionaries are unordered.\n",
    "List: Stores elements in a sequence, and each element is identified by its index (position) in the list. Lists are ordered and allow duplicate elements."

    "**Ans:** If you try to access spam['foo'] when spam is {'bar': 100}, it will raise a KeyError because the key 'foo' does not exist in the dictionary spam. The dictionary spam only contains the key 'bar', so trying to access 'foo' will result in an error."
